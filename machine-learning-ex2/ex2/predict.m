function p = predict(theta, X)
%PREDICT Predict whether the label is 0 or 1 using learned logistic
%regression parameters theta
%   p = PREDICT(theta, X) computes the predictions for X using a
%   threshold at 0.5 (i.e., if sigmoid(theta'*x) >= 0.5, predict 1)

threshold = 0.5;

m = size(X, 1); % Number of training examples

% You need to return the following variables correctly
p = zeros(m, 1);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using
%               your learned logistic regression parameters.
%               You should set p to a vector of 0's and 1's
%

p = round(0.5/threshold * sigmoid(X*theta));

% if threshold is 0.5, you can use: p = round(sigmoid(X*theta));
